Spectator Plus
==============

This project was created when I was exploring Minecraft's underworld map for tunnels and stuff.

It was pretty annoying to type `/effect give` and `/effect clear` all the time, so I came up with this idea.

Coding took 15 minutes, testing 5 and everything is working fine.

So I decided to release this plugin publicly.

Development
-----------
Project was created using Intellij IDEA Community with Gradle, so there you have everything that can be useful:
- development environment
- build tools
- git management
